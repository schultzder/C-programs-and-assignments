Begin by copying lab9.cpp to your J:\ drive. This contains the starting point of a program which, 
when completed, will maintain a list of baseball teams. Your program will read and process commands
from the standard input until end-of-file. Commands consist of a single character, possibly
followed by parameters.

The commands you are to implement are of the form:

	A team
 	D team
	P
	S 


1. A - Add a team, making sure the list isn't full and the team doesn’t already exist in the team
array. Add a new team to the end of the list. If the team already exists, don't add.  If the list 
is full, don't add.  In all cases, print a message. Team has no spaces. 

2. D – Delete team from the array if it exists.  In either case, print a message. Replace the 
deleted team with the last team in the list.

3. P – Print the list of teams.

4. S – Sort command. Sort it in ascending order (A - Z).  Print a message in either case.



It repeats this process until 
end-of-file: Use Ctrl-Z in Visual Studio for end-of-file.

Copy the file lab9.cpp to your J:\ drive or flash drive. 

The places you will need to modify are marked by "DO:" and numbered. BE SURE you don't make any 
other modifications to the file other than those marked by "DO:". For your convenience, the 
"DO:"s are marked with the order we recommend you tackle the problems.
